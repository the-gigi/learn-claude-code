# Overview

The goal of this project is to develop the ability to run multiple Claude Code (AKA CC from now on) instances on the same repo or set of
repos.  I want to have Claude Code itself do all the heavy lifting, so I need a CC sub-agent specializing in CC
configuration and customization:-)

I want to use git worktrees via [CCManager](https://github.com/kbwo/ccmanager)
